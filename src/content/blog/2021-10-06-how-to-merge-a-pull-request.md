There are some rules that are best to follow when merging a pull request.

When merging a pull request, GitHub offers 3 options:

- `Create a merge commit`
- `Squash and merge`
- `Rebase and merge`

We should use each of them depending of the situation:

- If PR has only one commit and commit explains well what was done use `Rebase and merge`
- If PR has only one commit but commit does not explain exactly what was done use `Squash and merge` and add commit name that will explain more exactly what was done
- If PR has more commits but they are intermediary (ex: fix style, add object, remove test ) also use `Squash and merge` and add a commit name that will group all commits in one
- If PR has more commits but every commit has an explicit title what has been done, each commit is a single unit, then use `Create a merge commit` so each commit will be visible in default branch
